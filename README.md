# Udacity Travel App Project

## Overview
This project requires us to build out a travel app that obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs. 

## Instructions
Please use 
`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install``` to install the needed packages.
- ```npm start``` to start the app.
- ```npm run test``` to run the test cases. 
- ``` npm run build-prod``` to run the program.
- This app runs on localhost:9000, but you can of course edit that in index.js
